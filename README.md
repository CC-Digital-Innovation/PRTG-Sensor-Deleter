# PRTG-Sensor-Deleter

## Summary
Deletes sensors by name on a given PRTG instance and outputs the results
to a log file.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
Decreases sensor count on PRTG instances (particularly crowded ones) to
increase response time and keep them organized.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.9.2
- configparser >= 5.0.2
- pandas >= 1.2.2
- pytz >= 2021.1
- requests >= 2.25.1

## Usage
- Add any additional filtering logic to the API URLs to get specific
  sensors if desired.
    - _Make sure you configure filtering options accordingly. Available
      options for filtering can be found on the PRTG API:
      https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/live_multiple_object_property_status#advanced_filtering_

- Add additional logic to include more than just one sensor name to delete.

- Edit the config.ini file with relevant PRTG access information and the
  timezone for the log file naming.

- Simply run the script using Python:
  `python PRTG-Sensor-Deleter.py`

## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This script
was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.9.2.
